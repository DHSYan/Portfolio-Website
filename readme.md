# FR THIS TIME
I have tried too many times to build a personal website. 

I did with only HTML and CSS once (twinkletoes5.com) => Not Interactive, not responsive

I tried using MERN Stack, NextJS, React (The previous try) => Too Complicated, Don't know what I was doing.

Now, for real this time, I am just going to use Vanilla JavaScript, with HTML and CSS to make a simple website that is responsive and interactive
